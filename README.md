# Overview

The interactive lessons in this repo are to be used with
Bert's Interactive Lesson Loader, the desktop app here 
[bert.bill](https://github.com/berttejeda/bert.bill).

# WebTerminal

Every lesson rendered through the app includes a web-based terminal emulator component
that allows for practicing the lesson material.

These web terminals are embedded in the user interface, 
available at its footer and as a slide-in from the right (click Utils to reveal).

Please consult the [bert.bill](https://github.com/berttejeda/bert.bill#readme) project for details on architecture and configuration.

With that said, from here on out I will make the assumption that your web 
terminal connection is ready and accepting connections from your computer.

You'll see plenty of error messages otherwise :)

# How to use these interactive documents

For every lesson, you'll notice that as you scroll down the lesson material,
a [terminal](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/) window will appear,
allowing you the opportunity to practice live commands against a sandboxed environment.

You need only click a sample commands to send the input directly to the terminal for execution.

This is similar to the experience you get with [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/)
and [Play with Docker](https://www.docker.com/play-with-docker).

Do read through the commands, do grok them, and do try them out!
